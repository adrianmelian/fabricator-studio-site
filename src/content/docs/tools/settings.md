# Settings

Your per-machine setup for FabricatorStudio. Settings holds everything that belongs to you
and this computer rather than to the project: where the shared project configs live, and
where each project's folders sit on your drives. Mindmeld defines the project. Settings
binds it to your machine.

Open it from the toolbar: left-click the gear button. Right-click on the same button keeps
the quick toolbar options (dock, layout, show and hide tools).

## Shared Configs Root

Where FabricatorStudio looks for project configs. By default this is your local Maya folder,
and solo users never need to change it. On a team, point it at the studio's shared configs
folder (a Perforce or network path) with Browse. Use Local Default switches back.

The status line shows which source is winning. If your studio sets the
FABRICATOR_PROJECT_CONFIGS environment variable, that wins over anything picked here and
the field locks with a note saying so.

## Project Bindings

Every project at the current configs root is listed with a BOUND or UNBOUND pill. Select one
and set where it lives on this machine:

- Source Art Root (required): the top of the project's working files.
- Content Root (required): the engine content folder exports land in.
- Pose Library Root, Anim Library Root, Blueprints Dir (optional overrides): leave blank to
  keep them under Source Art Root at the subpaths the project defines. Set one only when
  this machine keeps that data somewhere else.

Bind saves your choices to a small file on this machine only. Nothing in the shared project
config changes, so binding works even when the shared folder is read-only. Different
machines can use completely different drive letters and paths; the project does not care.

## Maya Integration

Choose what FabricatorStudio installs into Maya at startup: the main menu, the shelves, the
hotkey set, and the Ctrl+Alt+RMB animation marking menu. Everything is on by default.
Turning one on builds it immediately; turning one off takes effect the next time Maya
starts.

## For teams

A new teammate's whole setup is this window: point Shared Configs Root at the studio's
configs folder, select each project, bind its two roots, done. Every FabricatorStudio tool
then resolves paths for this machine automatically.
