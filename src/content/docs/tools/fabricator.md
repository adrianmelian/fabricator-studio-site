# Fabricator

## What it does
Fabricator is FabricatorStudio's rigging tool inside Maya: you assemble an animation rig out of small reusable components (SimpleFK, AdvancedFK, FKChain, FKAim, SimpleIK, IKLeg, QuadLeg, IKArm, SplineFK, Ribbon, RibbonSpine, FollowJoint, and the always-present World) wired onto a skeleton, then click Build Rig to bake them into controls and constraints. Rig state lives in the Maya scene itself as network nodes joined by message connections (a `fab_registry` plus one `fab_<id>` node per component), not as name-string lookups or a project file, so renaming joints or controls doesn't break anything. One button (Build Rig / Edit Rig) toggles the whole rig between an editable Edit Mode and a built Animation Mode, and unbuilding captures each component's live state so rebuilding restores it.

## Quick start
1. Launch Fabricator (its entry point is `fs_window.FSWindow.show_window()`, which opens either a floating frameless window or, if a Fabricator dock is already open, docks into a Maya workspaceControl instead; right-click the brand bar to switch between the two).
2. File > New Rig: adopts the current scene's skeleton (or seeds a single root joint at the origin in an empty scene), prompts for a rig name, and drops a World component on the root automatically.
3. In the Canvas panel, select a joint (or a chain of joints), then double-click a component in the Palette panel (or drag it in) to attach it, e.g. SimpleFK on a spine joint, IKLeg on a leg chain.
4. Use the Skeleton Helpers Bar's "Aim Joints at Aimers" at least once before building: Fabricator's editable Armature stage drives joint orientation with live aim constraints, and Build Rig needs that orientation baked (jointOrient/rotateAxis zeroed) to pass its export-orientation check.
5. Click Build Rig. If pre-build checks find anything, a Build Issues dialog lists each one with a Fix button (or Build Anyway for skippable ones); once clean, the rig builds and the button relabels to Edit Rig.

## Workflow
- Two-window design: the same window class floats (frameless, remembers window size and splitter layout) or docks into a DevBot-hosted workspaceControl; right-click the brand bar's drag area for "Dock Fabricator" / "Undock Fabricator."
- Edit Mode (status bar shows "MODE: Edit") shows the three-panel splitter: Palette (component list plus a Templates section, factory-shipped and project blueprints, load by drag or double-click), Canvas (a tree of joints and their attached components, inline rename via double-click/F2, MMB drag-drop to reparent a branch, right-click for Mirror Limb / Duplicate Limb / Delete Limb on the clicked branch), and Properties (per-joint and per-component option editing, shown for whichever is selected).
- Animation Mode (status bar shows "MODE: Animation") is a stripped cockpit: rig name, the Edit Rig button, and the log only; the whole splitter (Palette/Canvas/Properties) hides.
- Skeleton Helpers Bar (above the rig-name row) is the Armature toolbox: Add Joint, Insert Joints Between, Aim Joints at Aimers, Rebuild All Aimers, Reset All Aimers, an aimer visibility (Show/Hide) toggle, Mirror Limb / Mirror Joints / Mirror Module, Duplicate Limb / Duplicate Joints, and a Live Mirror ("Symmetry") toggle that drives the opposite side live while posing.
- File menu (folder icon in the brand row): New Rig (Ctrl+N), Save Rig (Ctrl+S, snapshots the current rig to `<name>.blueprint.yaml` in the active project's blueprint library), and Delete Rig (wipes rig_grp, guides/pivots groups, every Fabricator network node and FAB_RigBinding node; skeleton, geo, and skin clusters are preserved).
- Build Options (collapsible, collapsed by default) currently exposes one flag: "Reset Control Shapes," which rebuilds controls from the library default shape instead of restoring persisted CV edits; it auto-unchecks after each build.
- Build Rig runs a pre-build check pass (`build_checks.py`) first: duplicated joint connections from viewport duplication/mirroring, orphaned modules pointing at deleted joints, missing aimers, pre-registry ("legacy") rigs, and Fabricator-version drift since the rig was last built. Fixable issues get a one-click Fix; ambiguous ones (e.g. can't tell which duplicate joint is the original) block the build until resolved by hand.
- On a clean build, Fabricator bakes orientation from the aimers, validates the export orientation contract (rotate carries orient, jointOrient/rotateAxis zeroed, the UE5-style convention FollowJoint and IKLeg's axis handling also target), builds each component in dependency order, wires space switching, bakes per-rig selection sets as ordinary Maya objectSets under `fab_selection_sets` (read by Pose Studio instead of re-deriving from scene walks), organizes the scene, locks `*_offset`/`*_grp` transform channels, colors joints and outliner entries by component side, and stamps the rig with the current Fabricator version.
- Edit Rig (the same button, relabeled once built) unbuilds: captures each component's live state onto its network node, deletes `rig_grp`, restores the skeleton to the bind pose captured at build time, and rebuilds the Armature (aimers restored from a registry-side snapshot), landing you back in Edit Mode with nothing lost.
- FollowJoint exists specifically to wire UE5 engine reference joints (`ik_foot_*`, `ik_hand_*`, `ik_hand_gun`) so the FBX animation export carries them as keyed engine refs; it has no control of its own, just a parent/scale constraint driven by the Properties panel's Follow Target dropdown.
- Fabricator sits between Skeleton IO (imports/exports the joint hierarchy as portable JSON in the same UE5 orientation convention Fabricator's export-contract check enforces) and Skin IO in the pipeline; `bootstrap_from_skeleton()` can seed a starter blueprint directly from a Skeleton IO JSON export.

## Gotchas
- Save Rig requires Edit Mode. Saving while any component is built raises `RuntimeError: Save Template: rig is built. Unbuild (Edit Rig) before saving a template.` A built rig's captured bind-pose snapshot is only a correct world-position stand-in for the root joint; saving it as a template would reload into a broken child-joint hierarchy.
- Duplicating joints in the viewport (or using Maya's own mirror-joint) silently extends the source component's joint connections onto the duplicate, because Maya's duplicate/mirror propagates outgoing `.message` connections. The pre-build check reports this as "Duplicated joints on N module(s)" and can auto-repair only when every original joint name is still resolvable; if an original was also renamed or deleted, it's flagged for manual fix in the Node Editor.
- Deleting a joint in the viewport that a component depends on leaves an orphaned module. Build Rig blocks with "N module(s) reference deleted joints" until the module is removed or the joint restored.
- Deleting an aimer curve in the viewport (rather than through Fabricator) leaves its offset node behind with no visible aim arrow. Build Rig reports "Missing N aimer(s)"; the fix recreates them from saved state, falling back to geometric detection of the joint's current aim direction.
- Mirror Module/Mirror Limb do not mirror per-instance space-switch targets by design (Adrian's call, 2026-07-05); the mirrored component only inherits the contract's default spaces. Re-add custom space targets in Properties after mirroring.
- A pre-registry ("legacy") rig, meaning no Fabricator registry, or a registry whose root joint no longer resolves, can't use Armature-era features (orientation-contract validation, aimer snapshots, version stamping). Never use File > New Rig to fix this; it deletes the authored modules. The pre-build check's "Adopt registry" fix wires up the registry without touching modules instead.
- Fabricator-version drift between when a rig was last built and the currently installed Fabricator is a warning only, never a blocker; a successful build re-stamps the rig at the current version.
- The rig-name field is read-only by default (click Edit to unlock it for one rename) and can't be renamed at all once the rig is built; unbuild first.

## Troubleshooting
**Build Rig button is disabled.** No Fabricator registry is loaded in the scene, or the current mode doesn't allow it. Run File > New Rig or load a template from the Palette's Templates section first.

**"No fab_registry in the scene. Load a blueprint first."** `build_modules()` (and several other operations) require a live registry node. Run File > New Rig or load a blueprint before building.

**"Rig cannot be built, blueprint issues: ..."** The scene-snapshot blueprint failed structural validation (e.g. a component references a joint that isn't in the skeleton block). Fix the listed issues and rebuild.

**"Rig cannot be built, fix these issues first: Duplicate short name ..."** Two or more transforms in the scene share the same short name, which breaks anything that resolves nodes by name. Rename the duplicates and rebuild.

**"Rig cannot be built, export orientation contract violations (rotate carries orient, jointOrient=0, rotateAxis=0)."** One or more joints still carry non-zero `jointOrient`/`rotateAxis` after the pre-build bake, usually because an aimer was never run or was deleted. Run "Aim Joints at Aimers," then build again.

**"N joint(s) have no aimer curve (deleted in the viewport?)" (`MissingAimersError`).** Run "Aim Joints at Aimers" or "Rebuild All Aimers" to recreate them, or choose "Build Anyway" in the Build Issues dialog to skip them and keep their current orientation.

**Mirror Module/Mirror Limb fails with "joint ... has no side token; cannot derive R counterpart."** The joint name doesn't carry a side token Fabricator's side-token flipper recognizes. Rename with a proper side token, or hand-author the opposite-side component.

**Mirror Module/Mirror Limb fails with "R joint ... does not exist."** The mirrored-side joint hasn't been created yet. Run Mirror Joints first, then Mirror Module/Mirror Limb.

**Mirror Module/Mirror Limb fails with "component id ... already exists."** A component already occupies the target R-side joints. Remove it first, unless its joints were deleted, in which case Fabricator auto-cleans the orphan and re-mirrors.

**Save Rig fails with "rig is built. Unbuild (Edit Rig) before saving a template."** Click Edit Rig to unbuild, then Save Rig.

**Save Limb fails with "these components extend outside the selected subtree."** A component under the anchor joint owns a joint outside that anchor's descendant subtree, so the limb can't be cleanly extracted. Restructure so every component under the anchor stays inside the subtree being saved.
